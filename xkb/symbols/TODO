Keyboard Layout:
    I seem to have 3 options
    1) option 8 level:
        - figure out how to change to higher levels permanently
        - figure out how to change to higher levels quicklyâ€¯
        - figure out alt tab problem in higher levels
    2) multiple groups in one:
        - figure out how to change 
    3) multiple groups in multiple variants:

    - check xkb_symbols "rctrl_switch" { canada
    - check what mode_switch does
