Updating iomartin's answer from 2012-04-27: The documentation now lives at: https://www.charvolant.org/doug/xkb/html/node5.html

It is part of the "An Unreliable Guide to XKB Configuration" by Doug Palmer: https://www.charvolant.org/doug/xkb/html/xkb.html

Another introduction is "Changing Keyboard Layouts with XKB" by Michael Cardell Widerkrantz: https://hack.org/mc/writings/xkb.html

Or "A simple, humble but comprehensive guide to XKB for linux" by Damiano Venturin: https://medium.com/@damko/a-simple-humble-but-comprehensive-guide-to-xkb-for-linux-6f1ad5e13450

Other sources of information:

    Arch Linux Wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_keyboard_extension
    The XKB specification itself: https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html

There are also tools to assist with generating a layout configuration, like kbdgen: https://divvun.github.io/kbdgen/
